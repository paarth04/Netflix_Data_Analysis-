       Clean and preprocess real-world data
  
   Understand trends in Netflix content growth          
   
   Analyze:
                  Movies vs TV Shows
                  Year-wise content addition
                  Genre and category distribution
                  Country-wise content availability
                  Ratings and duration patterns
                  Visualize insights using charts and graphs
                  Strengthen Python and data analytics skills
